# The Odin Project: To Do List Project 
## The final assignment piece for the 'Organizing your Javascript Code' module
  
### Lab List - an ode to Trello
My attempt at recreating Trello's list & card UI.
I wanted to use this project as a chance to really push myself and create something that felt closer to real app rather than a project. This was also my first attempt working with drag and drop, and using npm to import additonal libraries beyond what's laid out in the course.
  
  Intended learning outcomes: 
  - Exploration of Object Orientated Programing principles.
  - understand pros & cons of OOP Vs Functional Programing.
  - use of modules, npm and webpack.
  - utelize storage;
  - Push myself! 


### Notes:
- Drag n' drop not yet working on mobile.
- Sign in working via Firebase auth. I'd like to eventually move the storage from local storage to Firestore.
- Created purely for my own educational purposes and with no commercial interest. If you like this app and are not familiar with Trello, check it out here: www.trello.com... It's far superior and free!
