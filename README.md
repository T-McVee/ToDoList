# The Odin Project: To Do List Project 
## The final assignment piece for the 'Organizing your Javascript Code' module
  
### Lab List - an ode to Trello
heavily inspired by Trello's list & card UI.
I wanted to use this project as a chance to attempt to recreate something similar. This was also my first attempt working with drag and drop, and using npm to import additonal libraries beyond what's laid out in the course.
  
  Intended learning outcomes: 
  - Exploration of Object Orientated Programing principles.
  - understand pros & cons of OOP Vs Functional Programing.
  - use of modules, npm and webpack.
  - utelize storage 


### Notes:
- Not yet mobile optimized
- Sign in is not yet working - will eventually be integrated to Firebase.
- Created purely for my own educational purposes and with no commercial interest. If you like this app and are not familiar with Trello, check it out here: www.trello.com... It's far superior and free!
